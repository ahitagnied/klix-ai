Klix is a real-time AI voice agent evaluation system that transcribes calls, applies predefined feedback criteria, and accelerates bug detection. Inspired by Fixaâ€™s (YC F24) approach to performance analysis, Klix streamlines how you monitor and refine voice-based user interactions.

## Features

*   **Real-time Transcription:** Transcribes calls in real-time using OpenAI's Whisper API.
*   **AI-Powered Feedback:**  Provides feedback on agent performance based on predefined criteria.
*   **Bug Detection:** Helps identify and pinpoint bugs in the voice agent system quickly.
*   **Twilio Integration:** Leverages Twilio for handling voice calls and media streams.
*   **OpenAI Integration:** Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 for natural language processing and AI responses.
*   **Wave File Recording:** Records both inbound and outbound audio to WAV files for later analysis.

## Usage

1.  **Set up environment variables:** Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and fill in the necessary API keys and credentials.
2.  **Run the server:** Execute `python main.py` to start the server.
3.  **Make a call (optional):** To make a test call, run `python main.py --call=+1XXXXXXXXXX` (replace with a valid phone number).  The script will check if the number is allowed based on Twilio configuration.
4.  **Access the web interface (optional):**  The server provides a basic JSON endpoint at `/`.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language for the backend.
*   **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs.
*   **WebSockets:** Enables real-time bidirectional communication between the client (Twilio) and the server.
*   **Twilio:** A cloud communications platform used for handling voice calls.
*   **OpenAI:**  Provides the large language model and real-time transcription capabilities.  Specifically, utilizes GPT-4 and the `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` model.
*   **PyDub:** Used for audio manipulation and overlaying audio files.
*   **uvicorn:** An ASGI server implementation used to run the FastAPI application.
*   **python-dotenv:** Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
*   **requests:** Used for making HTTP requests (although usage in this specific code is minimal).
*   **websockets:** A library providing WebSocket client functionality.
*   **audioop:** A Python module for basic audio operations.
*   **wave:**  A Python module for working with WAV audio files.

## Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables in a `.env` file:

*   `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
*   `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Your Twilio Account SID.
*   `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Twilio Auth Token.
*   `PHONE_NUMBER_FROM`: Your Twilio phone number.
*   `DOMAIN`: The domain name or IP address of the server (defaults to `localhost`).
*   `PORT`: The port the server listens on (defaults to 5050).

## API Documentation

The application has a single endpoint:

*   `/`: Returns a JSON message indicating that the server is running.  Example: `{"message": "twilio media stream server is running!"}`.

The main functionality is provided through the `/media-stream` WebSocket endpoint.  This is not a standard REST API; it handles the real-time bidirectional communication with Twilio.

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for a complete list of project dependencies.

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Testing

Basic testing is implemented in `tests/test.py`. This script demonstrates how to overlay the inbound and outbound WAV files after a call.  More comprehensive testing is needed.
